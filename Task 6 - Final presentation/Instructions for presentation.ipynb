2- Any unique value-addition or innovative idea implemented in analysis or presentation

3- Creative elements (beyond the template) included to improve engagement

4- Data points consistently referenced across different sections (e.g., methodology linked to findings)

5- he coherent narrative flow of the presentation

6- Relevant findings tied to real-world trends or industry implications

- Step 2

Convert your final presentation into .pdf format.

As part of your grade for the final assignment, you will be asked to upload your presentation for peer review.
